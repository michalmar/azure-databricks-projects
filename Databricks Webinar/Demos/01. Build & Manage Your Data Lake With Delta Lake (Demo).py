# MAGIC ## Demo: Building a reliable data pipeline with Delta Lake
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For this demo, we will use a public data set of loans from Lending Club. It includes all funded loans from 2012 to 2017. Each loan includes demographic information provided by the applicant, as well as the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. For a full view of the data please view the data dictionary available [here](https://resources.lendingclub.com/LCDataDictionary.xlsx).

# MAGIC ### ![Delta Lake Tiny Logo](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/delta-lake-tiny-logo.png) Create Gold table
# MAGIC Now that our Silver table has been cleaned and conformed, and we've evolved the schema, the next step is to create a Gold table. Gold tables are often created to provide clean, reliable data for a specific business unit or use case.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In our case, we'll create a Gold table that includes only 2 columns - `addr_state` and `count` - to provide an aggregated view of our data. For our purposes, this table will allow us to show what Delta Lake can do, but in practice a table like this could be used to feed a downstream reporting or BI tool that needs data formatted in a very specific way. Silver tables often feed multiple downstream Gold tables.

# COMMAND ----------

# Aggregate the data
loan_by_state = loan_stats.groupBy("addr_state").count()

# Configure destination path
DELTALAKE_GOLD_PATH = "/ml/gold_loan_by_state"

# Write out the table
loan_by_state.write.format('delta').save(DELTALAKE_GOLD_PATH)

# Register the SQL table in our database
spark.sql(f"CREATE TABLE gold_loan_stats USING delta LOCATION '{DELTALAKE_GOLD_PATH}'")

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC These cells showcase streaming and batch concurrent queries (inserts and reads)
# MAGIC * This notebook will run an `INSERT` every 10s against our `loan_stats_delta` table
# MAGIC * We will run two streaming queries concurrently against this data
# MAGIC * Note, you can also use `writeStream` but this version is easier to run in DBCE

# COMMAND ----------

# Read the insertion of data
loan_by_state_readStream = spark.readStream.format("delta").load(DELTALAKE_GOLD_PATH)
loan_by_state_readStream.createOrReplaceTempView("loan_by_state_readStream")

  # Execute Insert statement
  insert_sql = "INSERT INTO gold_loan_stats VALUES ('IA', 450)"
  spark.sql(insert_sql)
  print('gold_loan_stats: inserted new row of data, loop: [%s]' % i)
    
  # Loop through
  i = i + 1
  time.sleep(10)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC **Note**: Once the previous cell is finished and the state of Iowa is fully populated in the map (in cell 14), click *Cancel* in Cell 14 to stop the `readStream`.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Let's review our current set of loans using our map visualization.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Review current loans within the `gold_loan_stats` Delta Lake table
# MAGIC SELECT addr_state, SUM(`count`) AS loans
# MAGIC FROM gold_loan_stats
# MAGIC GROUP BY addr_state

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Observe that the Iowa (middle state) has the largest number of loans due to the recent stream of data.  Note that the original `gold_loan_stats` table is updated as we're reading `loan_by_state_readStream`.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##![Delta Lake Logo Tiny](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/delta-lake-tiny-logo.png) Full DML Support
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Note**: Full DML Support is a feature also in Delta Lake
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Delta Lake supports standard DML including UPDATE, DELETE and MERGE INTO providing developers more controls to manage their big datasets.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Let's start by creating a traditional Parquet table

# COMMAND ----------

# Load new DataFrame based on current Delta table
lbs_df = sql("SELECT * FROM gold_loan_stats")

# Save DataFrame to Parquet
lbs_df.write.mode("overwrite").parquet("loan_by_state.parquet")

# Reload Parquet Data
lbs_pq = spark.read.parquet("loan_by_state.parquet")

# Create new table on this parquet data
lbs_pq.createOrReplaceTempView("loan_by_state_pq")

# Review data
display(sql("select * from loan_by_state_pq"))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ###![Delta Lake Logo Tiny](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/delta-lake-tiny-logo.png) DELETE Support
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The data was originally supposed to be assigned to `WA` state, so let's `DELETE` those values assigned to `IA`

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Attempting to run `DELETE` on the Parquet table
# MAGIC DELETE FROM loan_by_state_pq WHERE addr_state = 'IA'

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md **Note**: This command fails because the `DELETE` statements are not supported in Parquet, but are supported in Delta Lake.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Running `DELETE` on the Delta Lake table to remove records from Iowa
# MAGIC DELETE FROM gold_loan_stats
# MAGIC WHERE addr_state = 'IA'

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC As you can see below, after running the `DELETE` command, records containing loans from Iowa have been successfully deleted.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Review current loans within the `gold_loan_stats` Delta Lake table
# MAGIC SELECT addr_state, SUM(`count`) AS loans
# MAGIC FROM gold_loan_stats
# MAGIC GROUP BY addr_state

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ###![Delta Lake Logo Tiny](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/delta-lake-tiny-logo.png) UPDATE Support
# MAGIC The loan data that we assigned to `IA` was originally supposed to be assigned to `WA` state, so let's `UPDATE` those values.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Attempting to run `UPDATE` on the Parquet table
# MAGIC UPDATE loan_by_state_pq SET `count` = 2700 WHERE addr_state = 'WA'

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md **Note**: This command fails because the `UPDATE` statements are not supported in Parquet, but are supported in Delta Lake.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Running `UPDATE` on the Delta Lake table
# MAGIC UPDATE gold_loan_stats SET `count` = 2700 WHERE addr_state = 'WA'

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md As you can see, we successfully ran an `UPDATE` to move those loans from Iowa to Washington state.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Review current loans within the `gold_loan_stats` Delta Lake table
# MAGIC SELECT addr_state, SUM(`count`) AS loans
# MAGIC FROM gold_loan_stats
# MAGIC GROUP BY addr_state

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ###![Delta Lake Logo Tiny](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/delta-lake-tiny-logo.png) MERGE INTO Support
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### INSERT or UPDATE with Parquet: 7-step process
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC With a legacy data pipeline, to insert or update a table, you must:
# MAGIC 1. Identify the new rows to be inserted
# MAGIC 2. Identify the rows that will be replaced (i.e. updated)
# MAGIC 3. Identify all of the rows that are not impacted by the insert or update
# MAGIC 4. Create a new temp based on all three insert statements
# MAGIC 5. Delete the original table (and all of those associated files)
# MAGIC 6. "Rename" the temp table back to the original table name
# MAGIC 7. Drop the temp table
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ![](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/merge-into-legacy.gif)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### INSERT or UPDATE with Delta Lake: 2-step process
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC With Delta Lake, inserting or updating a table is a simple 2-step process: 
# MAGIC 1. Identify rows to insert or update
# MAGIC 2. Use the `MERGE` command

# COMMAND ----------

# Let's create a simple table to merge
items = [('IA', 0), ('CA', 2500), ('OR', 0)]
cols = ['addr_state', 'count']
merge_table = spark.createDataFrame(items, cols)
merge_table.createOrReplaceTempView("merge_table")
display(merge_table)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Instead of writing separate `INSERT` and `UPDATE` statements, we can use a `MERGE` statement. 

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC MERGE INTO gold_loan_stats as d
# MAGIC USING merge_table as m
# MAGIC on d.addr_state = m.addr_state
# MAGIC WHEN MATCHED THEN 
# MAGIC   UPDATE SET *
# MAGIC WHEN NOT MATCHED 
# MAGIC   THEN INSERT *

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Review current loans within the `gold_loan_stats` Delta Lake table
# MAGIC SELECT addr_state, SUM(`count`) AS loans
# MAGIC FROM gold_loan_stats
# MAGIC GROUP BY addr_state

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##![Delta Lake Logo Tiny](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/delta-lake-tiny-logo.png) Schema Evolution
# MAGIC With the `mergeSchema` option, you can evolve your Delta Lake table schema

# COMMAND ----------

# Generate new loans with dollar amounts 
loans = sql("SELECT addr_state, CAST(rand(10)*count AS bigint) AS count, CAST(rand(10) * 10000 * count AS double) AS amount FROM gold_loan_stats")
display(loans)

# COMMAND ----------

# Let's write this data out to our Delta table
loans.write.format("delta").mode("append").save(DELTALAKE_GOLD_PATH)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md **Note**: The command above fails because the schema of our new data does not match the schema of our original data.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC By adding the **mergeSchema** option, we can successfully migrate our schema, as shown below.

# COMMAND ----------

# Add the mergeSchema option
loans.write.option("mergeSchema","true").format("delta").mode("append").save(DELTALAKE_GOLD_PATH)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Review current loans within the `gold_loan_stats` Delta Lake table
# MAGIC SELECT addr_state, SUM(`amount`) as amount
# MAGIC FROM gold_loan_stats
# MAGIC GROUP BY addr_state
# MAGIC ORDER BY SUM(`amount`) DESC
